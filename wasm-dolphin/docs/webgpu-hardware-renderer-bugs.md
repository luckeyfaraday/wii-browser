# WebGPU hardware renderer — open bugs

State of `?video=wgpu` measured across all 45 discs in the test library, same
machine, same harness, same day as the software-hybrid sweep it is compared
against. Every claim below was checked against the canvas screenshot, not the
verdict column.

Reproduce:

```bash
VIDEO=wgpu node tools/boot-matrix.mjs --library "<disc library>" --duration 45
```

## Status: the main defect is fixed

`ClearRegion` was honouring depth-only clears as colour clears, wiping a
fully-rendered EFB immediately before the XFB copy. Fixed in patch 0053.
The sections below are kept as the record of how it was found and what
remains.

### Measured after the fix, all 45 discs

| | software hybrid | `video=wgpu` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| mean unique visual fps | 7.1 | **23.2** |
| games with higher visual fps | - | 32 of 45 |
| boots | 43 | 41 |

Eight titles hold a locked 60 unique fps at ~100% game speed, each
screenshot-verified: F-Zero GX (8 -> 60 fps, 23% -> 101% speed), Wario World,
Mario Kart Double Dash, Kirby Air Ride, Pikmin 2, Melee (Rev 2), Pokemon Box.

F-Zero GX is the clearest case for the hardware path existing at all: it was
the software rasterizer's worst result in the library and is now among the
best.

### What still fails on the hardware path

| game | verdict | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Animal Crossing (RVZ + NKit) | static | issue #11, fails on BOTH backends |
| Resident Evil Code: Veronica X | black | unchanged, uninvestigated |
| Soulcalibur II | static | **not a defect** - parked on its autosave dialog, rendering correctly |
| Super Mario Sunshine | boots | menu renders, background still black |

Sunshine proves at least one more frame-destroying path exists. Three
hypotheses have been raised and measured away, so do not re-run them:

1. **`target_rc` partial clears.** Falsified. `ClearRegion` does still ignore
   the rect, but the EFB is 640x528 while games clear to 448 high, so EVERY
   clear is partial in every game -- Wario World issues 7,800 of them and
   renders correctly.
2. **The XFB copy is taken too early.** Falsified. The EFB passes before each
   copy use `loadOp=load`, so content accumulates ACROSS the backbuffer
   present. Re-aligning a frame as the span between XFB copies, Sunshine's
   copy captures ~196 draws including its largest batch. The backbuffer
   present is not the GX frame boundary; draw counts split across it look
   discarded and are not.
3. **The renderer cannot draw the scene.** Falsified. `DIAG_EFB_TO_CANVAS`
   (JS-only, no rebuild) blits the EFB straight to the canvas and shows
   Sunshine's complete file-select screen -- beach, palm tree, ocean,
   seagulls, Mario, file boxes, OPTIONS sign.

What remains is downstream of the copy: the **XFB blit source rect** (XFB#47
is a 2560x1024 atlas and the backbuffer is 320x240, so which region is sampled
matters) or the **copy's own source rect** (Sunshine copies 640x448 where
Wario copies 512x448, against a 640x528 EFB).

Methodological note, learned five times on this bug: **structure does not show
content.** Sizes, rects, bind targets and draw counts each produced a confident
wrong reading. The only probe that read actual pixels contradicted the
structural inference immediately. Measure output, not description.

---

## Summary (pre-fix baseline, kept for comparison)

| | software hybrid | `video=wgpu` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| boots | 43 | 39 |
| static | 2 | 4 |
| black | 0 | 1 |
| mount-fail | 0 | 1 |

The verdict counts understate the problem. The real split is by content type:

- **2D and UI render correctly.** Wind Waker's save dialog, Mario Kart's mode
  select, Sonic Heroes' team select, F-Zero GX's name entry, Twilight Princess
  and Pikmin 2 memory-card prompts are all correct.
- **3D scene content is missing or wrong.** This is where every defect below
  lives.

Speed is not a compensating win: 10 games faster by more than 5 points, 15
slower, mean 69.8% -> 61.2%. Large wins (F-Zero GX 23 -> 98) sit beside large
losses (Shadow the Hedgehog 101 -> 31). Both are scene-dependent; see the
measurement note in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Bugs

### 1. 3D geometry missing while 2D overlays draw — FIXED (patch 0053)

The clearest repro in the library, and the one to start from.

- **Wario World** — near-empty frame with two small tan rectangles. The software
  path renders a fully detailed castle throne room from the same scene. 97% game
  speed, `132/381 draw`, so draws are being submitted and mostly not landing.
- **Super Mario Sunshine** — the "File created." dialog renders correctly on
  pure black. The entire beach scene behind it is absent.

Both show the same shape: overlay/UI geometry survives, world geometry does not.
Draw counts are non-zero, so this is not a submission failure.

### 2. Colour/texture corruption in 3D scenes — FIXED for Luigi's Mansion (same cause)

- **Luigi's Mansion** — the mansion interior renders with correct geometry but
  desaturated to sepia. The software path renders it in full colour.
- **Kirby Air Ride** — the race scene renders but is heavily pink-shifted; grass
  that is green on the software path is pale pink here.

Geometry is right and lighting is plausible, so this points at texture sampling,
format, or a TEV/blend stage rather than at transform or rasterisation.

### 3. Melee mount is intermittent on the hardware path — OPEN (issue #10)

Across four runs of `video=wgpu` on Super Smash Bros. Melee: two boot normally
(96-99% game speed, correct character-select render), two fail with
`mount-fail` after a 120s timeout. Roughly 50%, on the project's primary target.
The software path did not fail to mount once across three full sweeps.

### 4. Unique-frame rate is unmeasurable on the hardware path — FIXED (issue #7)

Every hardware run reports `0.0 visual` while the canvas demonstrably produces
40+ distinct frames. Visual FPS is derived from `xfb-hash`, which the hardware
path bypasses (`visualSampleSource` in `upstream-discio-worker.js`).

This matters more than it looks. The entire justification for the hardware
renderer is beating the software rasteriser's unique-frame ceiling, and that
number currently cannot be measured on the path meant to beat it. Any perf claim
about `video=wgpu` is unsupported until this is fixed.

### 5. Resident Evil Code: Veronica X renders black — OPEN

Verdict `black` for the whole window. Lower confidence than the others: the
software run was on a different scene at the 45s mark, so this may be an FMV
rather than a defect. Confirm against an earlier checkpoint before chasing it.

## Not bugs

Recorded so they are not re-investigated:

- **Naruto and Paper Mario** end their window on a blank frame on *both* paths.
  They are mid-FMV transition at 45s and render correctly at earlier checkpoints.
- **SoulCalibur 2 Plus** is `static` because it holds an autosave dialog. The
  frame is correct.

## Suggested order (updated)

Bugs 1, 2 and 4 are resolved. What remains, in order:

1. **Super Mario Sunshine's missing background.** The one open rendering
   defect with a clear repro, but FIVE hypotheses have now been measured and
   rejected (see above, plus "presentation reads the EFB" -- Wario World
   renders correctly with a 0%-lit EFB at present time). Do NOT continue
   instrumenting the pipeline's description. Every wrong reading so far came
   from inferring content from structure: sizes, rects, bind targets, draw
   counts. Read back the BACKBUFFER TEXTURE itself after present, and bisect
   by suppressing individual passes to see which removal changes the image.
2. **Animal Crossing (#11).** Fails on both backends, so it is not a hardware-
   path bug. The EFB receives 178-188M colour writes and the presented buffer
   is still exactly zero, so the fault is in the EFB -> XFB copy.
3. **Melee mount intermittency (#10).** Needs a repeat-count harness; a single
   green run proves nothing.
4. **Kirby Air Ride colour (#9).** Never re-verified like-for-like -- the
   original report was a race scene, the post-fix check reached player select.
5. **Resident Evil Code: Veronica X.** Lowest confidence that it is a defect
   at all.

Screenshots for every game and checkpoint are written to the sweep output
directory (`page-t*.png` for HUD state, `canvas-t*.png` for the rendered frame).
