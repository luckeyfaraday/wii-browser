# wasm-dolphin architecture

Orientation for someone (or some agent) arriving cold. It describes what the
system is, how a frame gets from a disc image to the canvas, and which parts are
load-bearing versus experimental. Everything here was verified against the tree,
not inherited from older notes.

## What this is

Upstream Dolphin, patched and compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten, running
GameCube discs in a browser. The emulator core is real Dolphin — this repository
is a pinned upstream checkout plus a patch series plus a browser host.

It is **not** a recompiler. See [Execution model](#execution-model): PowerPC is
translated to WebAssembly at runtime, per hot block.

## Boot path

```
index.html
  └─ src/bootstrap.js          module entry; reaches app.js through a TOP-LEVEL AWAIT
       └─ src/app.js           DOM, settings UI, HUD, input wiring
            └─ src/core-host.js            EmulatorHost: URL flags -> options
                 └─ src/upstream-worker-adapter.js
                      └─ new Worker(src/upstream-discio-worker.js)
                           └─ cores/dolphin/dolphin-core-upstream.js + .wasm
                                └─ Emscripten pthreads (PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE=16)
```

Two things here bite anything automating the page:

- `app.js` evaluates **after** `domcontentloaded`, because bootstrap.js awaits its
  import. Anything that touches `#romInput` before then fires a change event at
  no listener: the input holds the file, nothing reads it, and the run dies on a
  mount timeout with `No file` still on screen. Wait for `#statusPill` to leave
  its initial `"Booting"` text.
- The HUD counters were renamed from `<metric>Counter` to `hud<Metric>`, and are
  not always updated. `window.__lastFrameInfo` carries the same values as
  structured fields, unconditionally. Prefer it. A stale id reads `""` -> 0, and
  0 is indistinguishable from a dead core.

## Execution model

Three tiers in `vendor/dolphin/Source/Core/Core/PowerPC/CachedInterpreter/CachedInterpreter.cpp`:

1. **Interpreter** — stock Dolphin fallback.
2. **CachedInterpreter** — stock Dolphin. Decodes a PPC block once into a list of
   C++ callback pointers and re-runs that list. No code generation.
3. **PPC -> WebAssembly JIT** — this project's own work, and the reason
   "cached interpreter" undersells it. For admitted hot blocks the C++ emits
   WebAssembly module bytes at runtime (the `{0x00,0x61,0x73,0x6d,...}` literal
   is `\0asm` plus version 1), hands them to JS through
   `EM_JS(DolphinWeb_CachedInterpreterCompileWasmBlock)`, which calls
   `new WebAssembly.Module()` / `new WebAssembly.Instance()` and invokes the
   result. Modules are keyed by hash and cached in IndexedDB across sessions.

So the pipeline is **PowerPC -> WebAssembly -> V8 native**: a double compile. The
JIT emits portable bytecode and relies on the browser engine to lower it. That
single fact explains most of the constraints:

- Each newly admitted block costs a *synchronous* `WebAssembly.Module()` compile
  on the CPU pthread, which is why admission is selective and why compile bursts
  are deliberately smeared.
- There are no cross-module direct jumps in WASM, so blocks return to a
  dispatcher instead of chaining. Block re-dispatch was the fix that recovered
  part of that cost.
- Host memory-trap fastmem cannot exist: the guest cannot catch host page faults,
  the engine owns the trap. The masked-bounds + direct-load path is the only
  in-browser fastmem available.

## Video paths

Two, selected by `?video=`:

| Path | Flags | What it does | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Software hybrid | `video=software&presenter=webgpu` | Dolphin's software rasterizer writes the XFB; JS uploads and blits it | **Shipping default.** 43/45 discs; accurate but capped at ~7 mean unique visual fps |
| Hardware | `video=wgpu` | Dolphin's WebGPU backend drives a command ring consumed in JS | **Experimental but working.** 41/45 discs; mean unique visual fps 23.2 vs the software path's 7.1, eight titles locked at 60 — see [webgpu-hardware-renderer-bugs.md](webgpu-hardware-renderer-bugs.md) |

`createWebGpuPresenter()` is **shared by both**. A change made there for the
hardware path lands on the shipping path too; that has already caused one silent
regression that blanked any game whose XFB is not 640x480.

The presenter itself is chosen by `?presenter=` (`webgpu` or `webgl`), and
swapping it is the cheapest way to split "the core produced nothing" from "the
presenter failed to show it".

## Provenance and the build

The core binary is reproducible from committed inputs, and the tooling fails
closed rather than warning:

- `provenance/dolphin-source.lock.json` — pinned upstream commit
  (`e22551e`), 53 ordered patches, external repositories.
- `provenance/dolphin-vendor-snapshot-v1.json` — per-path evidence of the
  patched tree.
- `provenance/dolphin-core-abi-v1.json` — the core's exported ABI plus the
  artifact hash and the hashes of local C++ sources.

Documented order, and it matters:

```bash
npm run verify:toolchain
npm run fetch:dolphin        # restores external repos; needs a PRISTINE vendor tree
npm run patch:upstream       # applies the 53 locked patches
npm run configure:upstream
npm run build:upstream:full-core
npm run update:core-abi      # after ANY change to core sources or the artifact
```

Traps worth knowing before losing an hour to them:

- `npm run` searches upward for `package.json`. Running it from inside
  `vendor/dolphin` finds the root manifest but sets `process.cwd()` to the
  submodule, so every provenance path resolves against the wrong root and the
  errors are nonsense. **Always run from the repository root.**
- `classifyLockedCheckout` only takes its bootstrap path on a *completely* clean
  vendor tree. Dirty nested submodules (`Externals/SFML/SFML`,
  `Externals/xxhash/xxHash`) push it down the snapshot path, which then reports
  ~100 "missing" files that are simply not patched yet.
- The build leaves `__pycache__` inside the spirv-tools checkout. Provenance
  treats those as extras and fails. Delete them before re-running.
- `git clean -fd` inside `vendor/dolphin` deletes the untracked glslang
  externals. `npm run fetch:dolphin` puts them back.
- `update:core-abi` also rewrites `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_CORE_SHA256` in
  `src/upstream-worker-protocol.js`. Rebuild without it and the worker rejects
  the core at `loadCore-entry`, which looks like a hang but is a fingerprint
  mismatch.

### The toolchain lock does not capture everything

The core committed before this checkpoint recorded the same emscripten 5.0.7,
compiler commit and emsdk commit as a fresh build here, yet contained
`FS.filesystems={MEMFS,NODEFS,WORKERFS}` where a fresh build produces `{MEMFS}`.
It was built against a different Emscripten than the one it records. The naga
staticlib hash differs the same way, under a byte-identical toolchain record and
a build that is otherwise bit-reproducible on this machine. Treat the toolchain
lock as necessary but not sufficient.

## Test harnesses

- `tools/menu-progress-validate.mjs` — depth. Drives Melee through a scripted
  route, samples HUD and canvas, captures screenshots and save-state round-trips.
- `tools/boot-matrix.mjs` — breadth. Boots every disc in a library for a fixed
  window and classifies each. Verdicts are `mount-fail` / `black` / `stalled` /
  `static` / `boots`, ordered so core-liveness is judged before pixel-change —
  those two disagree in both directions.

Both read the emulator's own counters, so a surprising verdict should be checked
against the canvas screenshots before it is believed. Three separate "broken
game" findings during this checkpoint turned out to be probe or tooling bugs.

## Working in a git worktree (agents, parallel investigation)

Three independent investigations in this repository were nearly invalidated by
the same environment problems. Check all three before trusting a single
measurement taken in a worktree.

1. **Confirm which commit you are on.** Worktrees have arrived checked out at
   an unrelated commit rather than the branch that was asked for. One agent was
   16 commits behind and would have tested a *pre-fix* core, producing a
   confident "still broken" verdict for a bug that was already fixed. It caught
   this itself; the next one might not.

       git log --oneline -1
       git merge-base --is-ancestor <expected-commit> HEAD && echo on-lineage

   The core is a committed prebuilt `.wasm`, so being on the right commit is
   usually enough -- no rebuild needed to get the current renderer.

2. **`vendor/dolphin` does not exist in a worktree.** It is generated by
   `fetch:dolphin` + `patch:upstream` and deliberately untracked, so a worktree
   cannot rebuild the core and cannot read the patched Dolphin sources. Tests
   that inspect them will fail -- that is expected, not a regression. C++ work
   has to happen in the main checkout.

3. **Playwright lives in the main repo only**, at
   `.omx/browser-probe/node_modules`. `tools/boot-matrix.mjs` resolves it from
   there, so a worktree needs that path junctioned or `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` set
   before any browser run.

## Measurement discipline

Learned the expensive way, and worth keeping:

- **A single run is not evidence for an intermittent failure.** Animal Crossing
  renders 5/6 runs on one branch and 0/6 on another. Three consecutive good runs
  were once reported as "fixed"; it was not.
- **Speed is scene-dependent.** The window average and the steady-state tail
  disagree in both directions — one game reads 27% over a window and 99.5% warm,
  another reads 95% then 24.5% once it reaches an FMV. Neither number is a
  compatibility grade, and a 2-3 point difference in a 45-game mean is noise.
- **Verdicts plus screenshots** carry the signal. Counters alone do not.
