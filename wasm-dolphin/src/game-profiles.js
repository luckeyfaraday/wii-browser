// Per-game renderer defaults, derived from measured sweeps of the test library.
//
// Both video paths are correct for most titles but differ enormously in unique
// visual frames, and a handful of games are actively broken on one of them. The
// right default is therefore per-game, not global -- but only where there is
// evidence. Anything absent from this table keeps the shipping default.
//
// Measurement basis: full 45-disc sweeps of both paths on the same machine and
// harness, comparing steady-state unique visual FPS, plus screenshot checks.
// See docs/webgpu-hardware-renderer-bugs.md and docs/perf-results/.
//
// Rules used to build the table, applied conservatively:
//
//   hardware — the frame was CHECKED BY EYE against the software render and is
//              correct, AND the hardware path is materially faster. A large FPS
//              win alone is not enough: a wrong frame can be fast.
//   software — the hardware path is broken for this title, or measurably worse.
//
// Titles with a big FPS win but no verified screenshot are deliberately left
// out. Being absent costs a little speed; being wrong ships a broken picture.
